# Bower Components
Bower is a package manager that will download the newest versions of css frameworks and javascript libraries with a single command line action. 
https://bower.io/

Common Bower packages are saved in the assets/common/bower\_components directory so they can be used across all three sites.

The Bower commands Iâ€™v used so far for this project are:
bower install slick-carousel
bower install removal
