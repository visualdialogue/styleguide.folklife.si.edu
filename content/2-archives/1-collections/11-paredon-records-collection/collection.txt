Title: Paredon Records Collection

----

Description: 

Founded in 1969 by Barbara Dane and Irwin Silber, Paredon Records was part of a wave of cultural expression that accompanied the worldwide struggle for economic, racial, social justice, and national liberation of the mid-twentieth century. The fifty titles released by Paredon are singular documents â€” some of the most relevant and moving song, poetry, and oratory of the times, created by the artists and leaders who lived them. Dane and Silber donated Paredon Records to the Smithsonian Institution in 1991 to insure the availability of this material to posterity.
