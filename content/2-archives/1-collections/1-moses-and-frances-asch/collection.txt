Description: 

Moses Asch (1905-1986) founded Folkways Records in 1948. Through the record label, Asch sought to document the entire world of sound. The 2,168 titles he released on Folkways include traditional and contemporary music from around the world, spoken word in many languages, and documentary recordings of individuals, communities, and current events. Folkways grew to be one of the largest and most influential record companies in the world.

The Smithsonian acquired Folkways Records, along with the label’s business papers and files, from Asch and his wife Frances in 1987, forming Smithsonian Folkways Recordings. Every album is kept in print.

In 2015, the Moses and Frances Asch Collection was inscribed to UNESCO’s Memory of the World International Register, a catalog preserving a promoting the world’s documentary heritage. It is the second Smithsonian collection added to the Memory of the World International Register, and one of only eight collections from the United States to be recognized.
