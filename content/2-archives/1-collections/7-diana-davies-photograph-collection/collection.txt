Copy: 

Diana Davies is a well-known photographer of folk performers and festivals, who photographed the Smithsonian Folklife Festival in its earlier years. The Davies photographs already held by the Rinzler Archives have been supplemented by a recent donation of additional photographs (contact sheets, prints, and slides) of the Newport Folk Festival, the Philadelphia Folk Festival, the Poor People's March on Washington, the Georgia Sea Islands, and miscellaneous personalities of the American folk revival.

For more information on this collection, please consult the Diana Davies Photograph Collection Finding Aid (38 page PDF). The finding aid is currently being revised to reflect additional photographs donated by Ms. Davies.
