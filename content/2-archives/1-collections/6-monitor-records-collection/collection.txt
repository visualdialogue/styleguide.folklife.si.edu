Title: Monitor Records Collection

----

Copy: In 1956, Michael Stillman and his business partner Rose Rubin started Monitor Records in New York City, to fill a gap they perceived in the music available to the American public--music from the then-Soviet Union, the Eastern Bloc, and other parts of Europe. Monitor has more than 250 folk and classical music recordings in its catalogue. The collection includes the original master tapes, graphics, and business records of the company.
