Blurb: <i>My Armenia</i> is driven by research and documentation methods developed by scholars to produce programs for the Smithsonian Folklife Festival. Working collaboratively with in-country researchers, including anthropologists, folklorists, ethnomusicologists, community-based scholars, and more, our goal is to expand and enrich existing scholarship. Additionally, we will create an archival record that will become part of the Smithsonian’s permanent collection—data that will inform future generations of researchers.

Contents: 

Our research teams work directly with communities to identify the cultural heritage they cherish most—the places, traditions, music, dance, craft, food, and other expressions that define their community identity. We will also document key knowledge and skills needed within a particular traditional practice. For a musician, this might include songs, instrumental skills, and performing styles; for a craftsperson, materials, designs, and techniques.

We will identify specific community members who are exemplars of their cultural practice, as indicated by their status and recognition within their community. All of this information is carefully documented and archived for future use and will form the foundation of community-based tourism development in Armenia.
