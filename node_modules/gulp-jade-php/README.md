gulp-jade-php
=============

Compiles [jade-php](https://github.com/viniwrubleski/jade-php) templates using gulp.

This module is based on the well written [gulp-jade](https://github.com/phated/gulp-jade).

### Usage

    var jade = require('gulp-jade-php');

    gulp.task('templates', function() {
      gulp.src('./views/**/*.jade')
        .pipe(jade({
            locals: {
              title: 'OMG THIS IS THE TITLE'
            }
         }))
         .pipe(gulp.dest('./dist'));
    });

### Options

Since this module based on gulp-jade, it supports everything mentioned in its [README](https://github.com/phated/gulp-jade#options).

Also you can customize the extension of the outputted files. By default the extension will be `.php`, but you can pass `extension: '.phtml'` to generate phtml files.
